> Tools that can solve complicated Math expressions and write codes for you.

On this page, a lists of tools that are designed to address Mathematics/Coding related questions will be shown. Same as the previous page, you can click on the titles to quickly jump to the tools.

### [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)

Compute expert-level questions related to linear algebra, calculus, physics, engineering, etc. through natural language input. It gives step-by-step math reasoning and can handle technical queries.

### [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/)

Create websites and apps with natural language. Good for rapid prototyping your ideas, especially when you are not technically experienced.

### [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)

An alternative to Bolt.new, some claims that Lovable to be more costly than Bolt.new but provides better result.

### [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)

AI powered code editor based on VScode. It utilizes LLM models of your choice to generate high quality codes. A representative tool of "Vibe Coding".

### [CompSciLib](https://www.compscilib.com/)
