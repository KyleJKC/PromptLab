> If you use AI, give it credit. Citations aren’t just for books or articles—they also apply when you use tools that generate text or ideas.

When you ask AI for help—rewriting, idea generation, grammar, summaries—you need to know how to cite what it gave you. On this page, you’ll learn accepted citation styles, how to include prompts/responses, and what your institution might expect.

## 1. Why Citation Matters

- It gives transparency: instructors/readers know what parts were assisted.
- It protects you: avoids accusations of plagiarism.
- It helps trace sources when something is wrong (AI hallucinations, errors).
- It aligns with academic norms: tools, data, software are often cited in research.

## 2. What to Attribute

You should attribute or cite:

- Direct text from AI (quotes)
- Paraphrased ideas from AI
- Substantial content from AI (examples, outlines, large pieces)
- The tool’s identity (name + version if possible)
- The date you accessed or used the tool / prompt

## 3. Citation Guidelines by Style

Here is how some common citation styles recommend citing AI/generative tools:

| Style                      | In-Text / Footnote                                                                                                                 | Reference / Works Cited Format / Example                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **APA**                    | Use in-text: e.g., _(OpenAI, 2025)_ or _(ChatGPT, 2025)_ when quoting or paraphrasing.                                             | Reference: _OpenAI. (2025, Month Day). ChatGPT (Model version) [Large language model]. Retrieved from https://chat.openai.com/_                                                                 |
| **MLA**                    | In-text citation or parenthetical note naming the tool: _(ChatGPT)_ when quoting/paraphrasing. | Works Cited: _“Prompt.” OpenAI, day Month year, chat.openai.com/_ or similar. MLA tends to treat AI tools more like software/tools rather than authors. |

## 4. How to Include AI Inputs or Prompts

If your work depends significantly on what you asked the AI (prompt + response), good practice is to:

- Save the prompt you used.
- If you include parts of AI’s response verbatim, put in quotes or block quote.
- Consider including the full prompt + response in an appendix or footnote (if allowed).
- Indicate what modifications you made (if you edited/refined AI output).

## 5. Examples

**APA Example**

> In-text: _(OpenAI, 2025)_  
> Reference:  
> OpenAI. (2025, August 28). _ChatGPT (GPT-4)_ [Large language model]. Retrieved from https://chat.openai.com

**MLA Example**

> In‐text: _(ChatGPT)_  
> Works Cited:  
> “Describe the symbolism of the green light in the book The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.” Prompt. ChatGPT, 13 Feb. version, OpenAI, 8 Mar. 2023, chat.openai.com/chat.

## 6. Institutional Expectations & Policies

- Many universities now require you to **cite AI tools** when used in coursework.
- Some policies allow AI use only with acknowledgment; others ban full AI-generated content. Always check your course syllabus or institution policy.

---

## Summary

- Always give credit when you use AI tools: quoting, paraphrasing, or using substantial content.
- Use the citation style required (APA, MLA, etc.), including tool name, version, access date.
- Be transparent about prompts and edits.
- When in doubt, include the attribution—it’s safer and more ethical.
