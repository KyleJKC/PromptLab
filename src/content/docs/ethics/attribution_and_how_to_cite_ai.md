> If you use AI, give it credit. Citations aren’t just for books or articles—they also apply when you use tools that generate text or ideas.

When you ask AI for help—rewriting, idea generation, grammar, summaries—you need to know how to cite what it gave you. On this page, you’ll learn accepted citation styles, how to include prompts/responses, and what your institution might expect.

## 1. Why Citation Matters

- It gives transparency: instructors/readers know what parts were assisted.
- It protects you: avoids accusations of plagiarism.
- It helps trace sources when something is wrong (AI hallucinations, errors).
- It aligns with academic norms: tools, data, software are often cited in research.

## 2. What to Attribute

You should attribute or cite:

- Direct text from AI (quotes)
- Paraphrased ideas from AI
- Substantial content from AI (examples, outlines, large pieces)
- The tool’s identity (name + version if possible)
- The date you accessed or used the tool / prompt

## 3. Why AI Citations Are Different

Unlike traditional sources, AI-generated content:

* **Is non-retrievable**: No one else can access the exact same ChatGPT conversation unless you share it.
* **Depends on prompts**: The wording of your prompt shapes the response, making it part of the source context.
* **Evolves over time**: AI models are updated regularly, so version and date matter.

For these reasons, citation styles emphasize **transparency** (showing you used AI) and **context** (providing prompts or descriptions of use).

## 4. Citing AI in MLA Style (9th Edition, 2023 Update)

MLA treats AI-generated text as a type of **source created by software** and explicitly recommends including the **prompt** you used.

### Works Cited Entries

**Format:**

> *Tool name*. Company, Date of use. Prompt: *“\[Your prompt here]”*. URL.

**Example:**

> *ChatGPT*. OpenAI, 5 Mar. 2023. Prompt: *“Explain the symbolism of the green light in The Great Gatsby.”* chat.openai.com.

### In-Text Citations

* General citation:

  > (ChatGPT)

* Narrative citation:

  > According to ChatGPT, …

## 5. Citing AI in APA Style (7th Edition)

APA treats AI responses as **personal communications**, since they are not publicly retrievable. At the same time, APA recommends including a reference entry for the AI system itself (the software), much like you would for a database or app.

### In-Text Citations

* Cite the conversation as a personal communication:

  > (ChatGPT, personal communication, March 5, 2023)

* Or in narrative form:

  > ChatGPT (personal communication, March 5, 2023) explained that…

### Reference List Entries

Include the AI tool itself (the retrievable part) in your reference list:

**Format:**

> Company. (Year). *Tool name* (Version) \[Large language model]. URL

**Example:**

> OpenAI. (2023). *ChatGPT* (Mar 14 version) \[Large language model]. [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/)

⚠️ Note: **Prompts are optional** in APA. You may include them in the text or appendix if they are relevant to your research, but not in the reference list.

## 6. Side-by-Side Example

Imagine you asked ChatGPT: *“Summarize the causes of the French Revolution in 3 sentences.”* Here’s how you would cite it in each style.

### APA

* **In-text:**

  > (ChatGPT, personal communication, September 25, 2025)
* **Reference list:**

  > OpenAI. (2025). *ChatGPT* (GPT-5, September 2025 version) \[Large language model]. [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/)

### MLA

* **Works Cited:**

  > *ChatGPT*. OpenAI, 25 Sept. 2025. Prompt: *“Summarize the causes of the French Revolution in 3 sentences.”* chat.openai.com.
* **In-text:**

  > (ChatGPT)

## 7. Best Practices for Citing AI

* **Always check your instructor or publisher’s requirements** — not all institutions have the same rules.
* **Be transparent**: State when and how you used AI in your methodology or introduction.
* **Include prompts when required** (MLA) or when helpful for clarity (APA).
* **Do not over-rely on AI**: Use it as a support tool, not a replacement for authoritative sources.

## 8. Summary

- Always give credit when you use AI tools: quoting, paraphrasing, or using substantial content.
- Use the citation style required (APA, MLA, etc.), including tool name, version, access date.
- Be transparent about prompts and edits.
- When in doubt, include the attribution—it’s safer and more ethical.
